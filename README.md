# SupplyChainFinancePlatform_basedOnBlockChain

This project is a blockchain (Ethereum)-based supply chain financial platform that allows companies to access through a browser, register a confirmation certificate on the blockchain, and obtain core corporate credit transfers, thereby efficiently obtaining financing from financial institutions.

The platform generally adopts the MVC (Model-View-Controller) three-tier architecture. The Truffle framework is used on the chain end combined with the Ganache blockchain, and the front end uses Vue.js combined with the Bootstrap framework. The two interact through Web.js and Metamask.
